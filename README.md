# volume-control-using-opencv

In this project I have used a hand tracking module to detect hand and its land marks. The module is available [here](https://github.com/avdhootu27/hand-tracking).

The distance between tip of index finger and thumb is used as volume range and used [pycaw](https://github.com/AndreMiras/pycaw) library to set the volume.
